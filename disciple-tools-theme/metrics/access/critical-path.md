# Disciple.Tools | Metrics: Critical Path

The Critical Path report gives you a complete overview of your ministry's health and progress. It summarizes all key activities across your entire project, from the first outreach to the multiplication of disciples and churches. This report is a key tool for leaders who want to track movement-wide trends.

## How to Access the Critical Path Report
1. Go to the **Metrics** area in the main menu.
2. Select **Critical Path** from the **Access** section.

## Understanding the Critical Path Report

The Critical Path report is a table that shows a summary of activity over a time period you choose. You can use the date filter at the top of the page to see data for a specific range, like the last month, the last year, or the entire history of the project.

The report is divided into sections that follow the typical spiritual journey.

### Outreach
This section tracks the first activities you use to make new connections. It often includes metrics from connected services like social media or websites.
- **Metrics**: The exact metrics you see here depend on what your system is tracking. They can include things like `Website Visitors` or `Social Media Interactions`.
- **Value**: The number of interactions that happened during the time period you selected.
- **Total**: The total number of these interactions since you started tracking.

### Follow Up
This section tracks the progress of new contacts as they move through your discipleship process.
- **New Contacts**: The number of new contacts added in the time period you selected.
- **Assigned Contacts**: The number of contacts that were given to a user for follow-up.
- **Active Contacts**: The number of contacts with an "Active" status.
- **Seeker Path Milestones**: This part of the report shows how many contacts have reached each step of your site's custom Seeker Path (e.g., `First Meeting`, `Ongoing Meetings`, `Being Coached`).

### Movement Training
This final section tracks the multiplication of disciples and churches, which is the main goal of a Disciple Making Movement.
- **Baptisms**: The total number of baptisms recorded.
- **Baptism Generations**: A breakdown of baptisms by generation (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) to show how disciples are multiplying.
- **Groups**: The number of active groups.
- **Churches**: The number of active groups that are marked as churches.
- **Church Generations**: A breakdown of churches by generation to show how new churches are being planted.

By looking at the numbers in each section, leaders can find areas where their discipleship process could be improved and celebrate where there is strong growth.
