# Disciple.Tools | Metrics: Sources Chart

The Sources Chart report helps you see which of your outreach channels are doing the best at bringing in new contacts. It breaks down your contacts by their "Source" and shows how contacts from each source are doing based on their status and where they are in the Seeker Path.

## How to Access the Sources Chart
1. Go to the **Metrics** area in the main menu.
2. Select **Sources Chart** from the **Access** section.

## Understanding the Report

This report has several charts that give you different views of your contact sources. You can use the date filter at the top of the page to look at contacts created during a specific time period.

### All Contacts by Source and Status
This is the main chart in the report. It shows a bar for each of your contact sources.
- **Each bar** represents one source (e.g., `Web`, `Social Media`, `Referral`).
- **The different colored sections** in each bar show the current status of the contacts from that source (e.g., `New`, `Active`, `Paused`, `Closed`).
- **The total length** of the bar shows the total number of contacts that have come from that source.

This chart helps you quickly see which sources bring in the most contacts and whether those contacts are currently active.

### Active Contacts by Source and Seeker Path
This chart shows only your "Active" contacts and where they are in the Seeker Path.
- **Each bar** represents one source.
- **The different colored sections** in each bar show how many active contacts from that source are at each stage of the Seeker Path (e.g., `First Meeting`, `Ongoing Meetings`).

This helps you understand which sources are bringing in contacts who are moving forward in their spiritual journey.

### Active Contacts by Source and Faith Milestones
This chart also looks at only your "Active" contacts, but it shows them based on the faith milestones they have reached (e.g., `Has a Bible`, `Baptized`).
- **Each bar** represents one source.
- **The different colored sections** represent the different faith milestones that have been recorded for contacts from that source.

This chart gives you an idea of which outreach channels are leading to important spiritual steps.
