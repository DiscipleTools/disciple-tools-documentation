# Disciple.Tools | Metrics: Transferred Contacts

The Transferred Contacts report gives you information about contacts that have been **sent to** other Disciple.Tools sites using the Site Linking system. This is a helpful feature for working with ministry partners, as it lets you see not only how many contacts you are sending, but also what happens to them after they are sent.

## How to Access the Transferred Contacts Report
1. Go to the **Metrics** area in the main menu.
2. Select **Transferred Contacts** from the **Access** section.

## Understanding the Report

This report is interactive and lets you see data from any site that is set up to receive contacts from your site. It shows you the status of the contacts on the *site that received them*.

### Using the Filters
At the top of the page, you will see two filters:
- **Date Range:** Choose the time period you want to look at. The report will show information for contacts that were sent during this time.
- **Site Links:** Choose one of the linked sites from the dropdown menu. The data shown will be for contacts **sent to** that specific site.

### Key Metrics Displayed
After you choose a site and a date range, the report will show several charts and a total count based on data from the receiving site:

- **Contacts Transferred:** A total count of all contacts **sent to** the selected site in the chosen time period.
- **Contact Status:** A chart showing the current status (`Active`, `Paused`, `Closed`) of the transferred contacts **on the receiving site**.
- **Seeker Path:** A breakdown of the transferred contacts by their current step in the Seeker Path **on the receiving site**.
- **Faith Milestones:** A chart showing the faith milestones that have been recorded for the transferred contacts **on the receiving site**.

These charts help you understand the spiritual journey of the contacts after they have been sent to another site, which gives you valuable feedback on how well your ministry partnerships are working.
