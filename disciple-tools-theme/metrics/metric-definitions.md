# Disciple.Tools | Metric Definitions

This document provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Metrics pages in Disciple.Tools. These terms help you understand the data and charts that measure ministry activity and progress.

## Contact and Seeker Metrics

### Seeker Path
The "Seeker Path" tracks a contact's spiritual journey in customizable steps. It begins from the first contact and follows their progress toward becoming a discipled believer. Each organization can customize these steps to fit their discipleship process.

### Needs Accept
"Needs Accept" is a status for a new contact that has been given to a user but has not yet been accepted by them. This status helps ensure that every new contact is quickly acknowledged and followed up with.

### Needs Update
"Needs Update" is a status for a contact who has not had any updates or changes logged in a while. This helps leaders see which contacts might need a follow-up to ensure no one is forgotten.

### Sources
"Sources" are the channels where new contacts come from, such as "Web," "Social Media," or "Referral." Tracking sources helps you understand which outreach methods are most effective for finding new contacts.

### Transferred Contacts
"Transferred Contacts" are contacts that have been shared from one Disciple.Tools site to another. The metrics for these contacts show their progress on the site that *received* them, which helps in understanding the effectiveness of partnerships.

## Group and Church Metrics

### Active Group
An "Active Group" is any group marked with a "Group Status" of "Active." This is a general term for any group that meets regularly, no matter the type.

### Active Church
An "Active Church" is a group that is marked as an "Active" group and also has a "Group Type" of "Church." This helps to specifically track the growth of mature groups that are functioning as churches.

### Church Planter
A "Church Planter" is a user who is leading a group with the "Group Type" of "Church." This metric helps identify the individuals who are actively planting and leading churches.

### Group Health Metrics
"Group Health Metrics" are customizable signs to track a group's health and development. Examples include tracking if a group has a "Leader," is "Practicing Tithing," or is regularly studying the "Word."

## Movement Metrics

### Critical Path
The "Critical Path" is a report that shows a summary of the entire ministry process, from the first outreach activities to the multiplication of disciples and churches. It gives a high-level view of the health and progress of a spiritual movement over time.

### Baptism Generations
"Baptism Generations" measure the multiplication of disciples.
- **1st Generation**: A person baptized by someone from the initial team.
- **2nd Generation**: A person baptized by a 1st Generation believer.
- **3rd Generation**: A person baptized by a 2nd Generation believer.
- And so on. This metric shows how well new believers are learning to make new disciples.

- **1st Generation**: A church planted by someone from the initial team.
- **2nd Generation**: A church planted by a 1st Generation church.
- **3rd Generation**: A church planted by a 2nd Generation church.
