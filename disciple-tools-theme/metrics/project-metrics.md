# Disciple.Tools | Project Metrics

Project Metrics give you a high-level overview of all activity happening across your entire Disciple.Tools site. These reports help leaders and administrators understand broad trends, track overall progress, and see the collective impact of all users.

To see these reports, go to the **Metrics** area in the main menu and look for the **Project** section.

**Note:** If you do not see the **Project** section under Metrics, it means you do not have permission to view these reports. You will need to contact your administrator to request access.
