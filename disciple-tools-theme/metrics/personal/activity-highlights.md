# Disciple.Tools | Metrics: Activity Highlights

The Activity Highlights report gives you a quick summary of your ministry activities and their results. It also shows you important updates made by other people on your contacts and groups. This helps you stay up-to-date and see your progress easily.

## How to Access the Activity Highlights Report
1. Go to the **Metrics** area in the main menu.
2. Select **Activity Highlights** from the **Personal** section.

## What This Report Shows

The report is split into two main columns: **Your Activity** and **Activity from Others**. You can filter the whole report by a specific date range at the top of the page.

### Your Activity
This column summarizes the actions you have taken yourself in Disciple.Tools. It includes:

- **Records Created**: The number of new contacts and groups you have created.
- **Milestones Reached**: Tracks when you have updated important milestones for your contacts, such as "First Meeting" or "Ongoing Meetings." It also tracks updates to group health (e.g., "Practicing Tithing").
- **Baptisms**: A count of the contacts you have recorded as baptized.
- **Comments Posted**: The total number of comments you have made on records.
- **Comments Reacted To**: The number of times you have "reacted" to a comment.

### Activity from Others
This column helps you know what other people are doing on the contacts and groups that you are assigned to. This is helpful for teamwork and tracking your team's progress.

- **Milestones Updated by Others**: Shows when another user updates a milestone on one of your contacts or groups. For example, if a team member marks one of your contacts as "Contact Established."
- **Baptisms by Others**: A count of baptisms recorded by other users on contacts that you are assigned to.

By looking at both columns, you can get a full picture of the activity related to your ministry, celebrating both what you have done and the work of your team.
