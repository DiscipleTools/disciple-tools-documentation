# Disciple.Tools - User Coverage Map

This document explains how to use the User Coverage Map in Disciple.Tools. The User Coverage Map provides a visual representation of where users are located, which is useful for understanding the geographic distribution of a team.

## Accessing the User Coverage Map

To access the Coverage Map, a user typically needs a role with strategic oversight permissions, such as Administrator or Strategist.

1.  Navigate to the **Users** list page by clicking the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right of the screen and selecting **Users**.
2.  On the Users list page, click the **Coverage Map** link in the navigation menu.

*Note: This feature requires a Mapbox API key to be configured in the site's settings.*

## Using the Coverage Map

The map displays geographic areas (e.g., countries, states) with a count of the users assigned to each location.

### Navigating the Map
*   Use the map controls to zoom in, zoom out, and pan to explore different regions.
*   Click a specific geographic area on the map to see a list of users assigned to that location.

### Filtering Users
At the top of the map, use the available filters to show or hide users based on criteria like their role or status. For example, you can filter the map to display only users with an "Active" status.

### Viewing a User from the Map
When you click a location and see the list of users, you can click any user's name to go directly to their user details page.
