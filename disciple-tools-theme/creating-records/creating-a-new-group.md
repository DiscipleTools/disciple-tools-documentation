# How to Create a New Group Record in Disciple.Tools

This guide explains how to create a new group record in Disciple.Tools.

## Accessing the New Group Form

You can create new group records in two primary ways:

**1. From the List Page:**
   - Navigate to the **Groups List Page** by clicking the **Groups** tab in the main navigation bar.
   - Click the green **Create New** button in the top action bar.

**2. From the Navigation Bar:**
   - Click the **plus icon (+)** located in the top navigation bar.
   - Select **New Group** from the dropdown menu.

Both methods will take you to the "Create New Group" page.

## Filling Out the New Group Form

The form for creating a new group contains a small set of core fields. After you create the group, you will be able to edit these fields and add much more information on the full group record page, including members, location, and church health metrics.

### Default Fields

The following fields are available when you first create a group:

-   **Name**: (Required) The name of the group.
-   **Group Type**: A description of the group's current stage.

### Group Type Selection

The **Group Type** is the primary way to categorize a group. The default options are:

-   **Pre-Group**: A group predominantly of non-believers.
-   **Group**: A group having 3 or more believers but not identifying as church.
-   **Church**: A group having 3 or more believers and identifying as church.
-   **Team**: A special group that is not meeting as a church (or trying to become church).

## Saving the Group

Once you have filled in the name and selected a group type, click the **Save** button. You will be redirected to the new group's record page, where you can continue to add and manage the group's information.
