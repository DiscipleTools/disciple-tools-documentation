# Manage Availability for New Contacts

This guide explains how to set your availability to receive new contacts in Disciple.Tools. By scheduling when you are unavailable, such as for travel or time off, you can prevent the system's Dispatcher from assigning new contacts to you during those periods.

## How to Manage Your Availability

### 1. Access Your Profile
**On Desktop**
Click on your **display name** in the top right corner of the screen to go to your profile settings.

**On Mobile**
1. Click the hamburger menu icon (â˜°) in the top right corner.
2. Click **Settings**.

### 2. Schedule Unavailable Dates
1. Once on your profile settings page, navigate to the **Availability** section.
2. In the subsection labeled **Schedule Travel or Dates Unavailable**, find the date pickers.
3. Click on the **Start Date** field and select the first day you will be unavailable.
4. Click on the **End Date** field and select the last day you will be unavailable.
5. Once both dates are selected, click the **Add Unavailable dates** button.

The period of unavailability will be added to a list below. The Dispatcher will now know not to assign you any new contacts during this time.

### 3. Remove Unavailable Dates
All your scheduled unavailable periods are displayed in a table.

- To remove a scheduled period, simply click the delete button in the row corresponding to the dates you wish to remove.

## Important Notes

-   This setting only affects the assignment of **new** contacts. It does not affect your access to existing contacts or other system functions.
-   This feature is for managing your capacity for new assignments, not for blocking out your calendar for meetings.
