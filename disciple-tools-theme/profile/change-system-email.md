# Change System Email

This guide explains how to change the primary system email address for your Disciple.Tools account. This is the email used for notifications and, in some cases, for logging in.

## How to Change Your System Email

### 1. Access Your Profile

**On Desktop**
Click on your **display name** in the top right corner of the screen to go to your profile settings.

**On Mobile**
1. Click the hamburger menu icon (â˜°) in the top right corner.
2. Click **Settings**.

### 2. Open the Edit Modal
*   On the settings page, find the "Profile" section.
*   Click the "Edit" button to open the window where you can update your information.

### 3. Update the System Email
*   Locate the **System Email** field.
*   Enter your new email address.

### 4. Save Your Changes
*   Click the "Save" button to submit the change.

## Important Notes

*   **Confirmation**: Changing your system email is a security-sensitive action. The system may require you to confirm the change by clicking a link sent to your new email address.
*   **Login Details**: If you use your email address to log in, you must use the new email address after the change is confirmed.
*   **Notification Delivery**: All system notifications will be sent to this new address. Make sure you have access to it to receive important updates.
*   **Contact vs. System Email**: This action changes your primary account email. It is different from the "Work Email" field, which is purely for contact information display on your profile.
