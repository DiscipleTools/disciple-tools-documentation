# Profile Settings: Apps

The "Apps" section in your profile settings gives you access to special features and tools within Disciple.Tools, often provided by add-on plugins. These apps use "magic links," which are secure, unique URLs created just for your account.

## How the Apps Section Works

- **Discovery**: The Apps section only appears in your settings if a plugin providing an app is active on your Disciple.Tools site. If you don't see an "Apps" section, it means no apps are currently installed.
- **App List**: When available, you will see a list of apps in a table. Each app will have:
    - **App Name**: The name of the application (e.g., "Prayer List").
    - **App Description**: A brief explanation of what the app does.
    - **App Link**: Buttons to access and copy the magic link for the app.
    - **App Activation**: A switch to turn the app on or off for your account.

## Using an App

### 1. Access Your Profile

**On Desktop**
Click on your **display name** in the top right corner of the screen to go to your profile settings.

**On Mobile**
1. Click the hamburger menu icon (â˜°) in the top right corner.
2. Click **Settings**.

### 2. Navigate to the Apps Section
Click on **Apps** in the left-hand navigation menu.

### 3. Activate the App
1. Find the app you want to use in the table.
2. Click the toggle switch in the "App Activation" column to "Yes."

When you activate an app, Disciple.Tools generates a unique magic link for you.

### 4. Access the App
Once an app is activated, you can access it using its magic link:

- **Link Icon**: Click the link icon ðŸ”— in the "App Link" column to open the app directly in a new browser tab.
- **Copy Icon**: Click the copy icon ðŸ“„ to copy the magic link to your clipboard. You can then save this link as a bookmark or share it.

**Important**: Your magic link is specific to you. Do not share it with others, as it provides direct access to parts of your Disciple.Tools account without needing to log in.

### 5. Deactivation
If you no longer need an app, you can deactivate it by toggling the switch in the "App Activation" column back to "No." This will disable your magic link, and it will no longer work.

## Example App: Prayer List

Some Disciple.Tools sites have a "Prayer List" plugin. When activated, it adds a "Prayer List" app to your Apps section.

- **Name**: Prayer List
- **Description**: A micro app for a daily prayer list.
- **Functionality**: Activating this app gives you a magic link to a simplified page showing contacts or groups you have marked for prayer. This allows you to access your prayer list on a phone or other device without logging into the full Disciple.Tools system.
