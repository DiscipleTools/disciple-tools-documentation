# Multiplier Preferences

The Multiplier Preferences section in your profile settings allows you to configure your preferences for being assigned new contacts. These settings help Dispatchers and Administrators know your capacity, skills, and focus areas, ensuring you receive contacts that are a good fit for you.

This section is only visible to users with roles that involve contact assignment, such as Multipliers, Dispatchers, and Administrators.

1.  Navigate to your profile settings:
    - **On Desktop:** Click on your **display name** in the top right corner of the screen.
    - **On Mobile:** Click the hamburger menu icon (â˜°) in the top right corner, then click **Settings**.
2.  On the settings page, scroll down to **Multiplier Preferences**.

## Configuration Options

### Locations

This setting allows you to specify the geographic locations you are willing to be responsible for. When new contacts from these locations are added to Disciple.Tools, dispatchers will know you are a candidate for assignment.

**To add a location:**
1.  Click the **add** button or start typing in the "Search Locations" box.
2.  A search field will appear. Type the name of a country, state, or city.
3.  Select the desired location from the list that appears.
4.  The selected location will be added to your list of preferred locations.

You can add multiple locations to your profile.

### Languages

Specify the languages you are comfortable speaking. This helps match you with contacts who speak those languages.

**To add or remove a language:**
1.  This section displays a list of available languages as buttons.
2.  Click on a language button to select it. The button will highlight to show it is selected.
3.  To remove a language, simply click it again to deselect it.

### People Groups

If your Disciple.Tools system uses People Groups, you can specify which groups you are focused on serving. People Groups are distinct ethnic or cultural groups.

**To add a People Group:**
1.  Start typing the name of a people group in the search box.
2.  Select the desired group from the list that appears.
3.  The selected group will be added to your profile.

This option will only be visible if People Groups have been configured by an administrator.

### Workload Status

This setting communicates your current availability to receive new contacts. This is different from scheduling time off; it reflects your general capacity.

There are three options:

- **Active**: You are actively accepting new contacts.
- **Existing Contacts Only**: You are only working with your existing contacts and are not available for new assignments.
- **Not Accepting**: You are currently not accepting any new contacts.

To set your status, simply click on the button corresponding to your current availability. The Dispatcher will see this status when considering you for new contact assignments.
