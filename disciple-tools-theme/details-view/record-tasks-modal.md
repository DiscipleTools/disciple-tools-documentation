## Viewing Existing Tasks

Below the creation form, there is a section titled **Existing tasks for this record**. This area displays a list of all tasks that have already been created for the record you are viewing. This helps you keep track of upcoming and pending tasks without leaving the record page.

## Due Date Notifications

When a task's due date arrives, the user who created it will receive a notification inside Disciple.Tools to serve as a reminder. Users may also receive an email, depending on their personal notification settings.

-   **For Reminders**: The notification will state that you set a reminder for that specific record.
-   **For Custom Tasks**: The notification will display the custom note you entered.

All task notifications include a direct link to the record, allowing you to easily navigate to the page and take any necessary action.
