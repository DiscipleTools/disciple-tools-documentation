# Disciple.Tools | Record Access and Sharing

This guide explains how record access works in Disciple.Tools, including who can see your records by default, how to share records with other users, and what automatically gives users access to records.

## Understanding Record Access

In Disciple.Tools, record access is controlled by a sharing system that determines which users can view and edit specific contacts, groups, and other records. Unlike some systems where all users can see all records, Disciple.Tools uses a permission-based approach to protect sensitive information.

## Contact Types and Access Levels

Different contact types have different default access levels:

### Standard Contacts
- **Visibility**: Accessible to the assigned user, shared users, and project leadership (Administrators/Dispatchers)
- **Purpose**: Contacts for collaboration and ministry work
- **Icon**: Share icon (indicates collaborative access)

### Private Contacts
- **Visibility**: "Only me" - accessible only to the creator, assigned user, and users specifically shared with
- **Purpose**: Personal friends, family members, or acquaintances
- **Icon**: Lock icon (indicates restricted access)
- **Important**: Even Administrators and Dispatchers cannot access these unless specifically shared with them

### Connection Records
These are automatically created when contacts are connected to each other and inherit the privacy level of the parent contact.

## Who Has Access by Default

### Administrator and Dispatcher Users
Users with Administrator or Dispatcher roles have special permissions that allow them to view and edit most records in the system, regardless of sharing settings. These users can access **Standard Contacts** without needing them to be specifically shared with them.

**Important Exception**: Administrator and Dispatcher users **cannot** access **Private Contacts** unless those records are specifically shared with them or assigned to them.

### Regular Users (Multipliers, Marketers, etc.)
Regular users can only access records that are:
- Assigned to them
- Shared with them by another user
- Created by them

## What Gives Access Automatically

Several actions automatically grant users access to records:

### Assignment
When you assign a record to a user using the "Assigned To" field, that user automatically gains access to view and edit the record. This includes:
- The primary assigned user
- Any sub-assigned users (contacts only)
- Coaching relationships (contacts only)

### Record Creation
When you create a new record, you automatically have access to it as the creator.

## How to Share Access

### Using the Share Button
1. Open the record you want to share
2. In the Details Bar at the top of the page, click the **Share** button
3. The Share dialog will open, showing who currently has access to the record
4. In the search box, start typing the name of the user you want to share with
5. Select the correct user from the search results
6. The user will be added to the shared list immediately and will receive a notification

### Using @Mentions in Comments
1. Open the record you want to share
2. Scroll down to the Comments section
3. Write a comment and include @username (start typing @ followed by their name)
4. Select the correct user from the dropdown that appears
5. Post the comment - the mentioned user will automatically gain access to the record and receive a notification

### Using Assignment Fields
You can also grant access by assigning users to specific roles:
- **Assigned To**: Assign the primary responsibility for the record
- **Sub-assigned** (contacts only): Add additional users to help with follow-up
- **Coaching relationships** (contacts only): Connect contacts as coach/disciple relationships

### What Sharing Provides
When you share a record with someone:
- They can view all information on the record
- They can edit and update the record
- They will appear in the "shared with" list on the record
- They can receive notifications about changes to the record

### Removing Shared Access
To remove someone's access to a record:
1. Click the **Share** button on the record
2. Find the user in the shared list
3. Click the "X" icon next to their name
4. Their access will be removed immediately

## Viewing Who Has Access

### Share Button Indicator
The Share button in the Details Bar shows how many users currently have access to the record. Hover over the button to see a tooltip listing all users with access.

### Share Dialog
Click the Share button to open the full sharing dialog, which displays:
- All users who currently have access to the record
- Their names and how they gained access (assigned, shared, etc.)
- Options to add or remove users

## Important Notes

### Privacy and Security
The sharing system is designed to protect sensitive contact information. Only share records with users who have a legitimate need to access the information for ministry purposes.

### Notifications
When you share a record with someone, they receive a notification informing them that the record has been shared with them. This helps them know they have new records to work with.
