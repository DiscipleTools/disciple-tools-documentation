# Disciple.Tools Details Page: Voice and Picture Comments

The "Comments and Activity" section on record detail pages in Disciple.Tools (like Contacts and Groups) allows you to add comments not just with text, but also with voice recordings and pictures. This feature provides a richer way to document interactions and leave notes.

This functionality is available only if the storage feature has been enabled by an administrator on your Disciple.Tools instance.

## How to Access Voice and Picture Commenting

1. Navigate to any record's detail page, such as a Contact or a Group.
2. Locate the "Comments and Activity" section.
3. Below the text comment box, you will find a microphone icon for recording voice messages and an image icon for uploading pictures. These icons appear to the left of the "Submit comment" button.

## Voice Message Comments

You can record and post a voice message directly within the "Comments and Activity" section.

### How to Record and Post a Voice Message

1. **Open the recorder**: In the "Comments and Activity" section, click the microphone icon. This will open the voice recording controls.
2. **Grant microphone access**: The first time you use this feature, your web browser will ask for permission to use your microphone. You must allow access to proceed with recording.
3. **Start recording**: Click the "Start Recording" button. A timer will begin, and a sound wave visualization will show that the system is capturing audio.
4. **Stop recording**: When you have finished your message, click the "Stop Recording" button.
5. **Preview your message**: After stopping, the sound wave visualization is replaced by an audio player. You can click the play button in this player to listen to your recording before posting it.
6. **Save the recording**: If you are satisfied with the recording, click the "Save Recording" button. The voice message will be uploaded and will appear in the activity feed.
7. **Cancel the recording**: If you want to discard the recording and not post it, click the "Cancel" button. This will close the recording controls and delete the audio.

Once saved, the voice message will appear in the activity feed with an audio player that anyone with access to the record can listen to.

## Picture Comments

You can upload a picture to be posted as a comment in the activity feed. This is useful for sharing screenshots, photos of events, or other visual information.

### How to Post a Picture Comment

1. **Open the upload modal**: In the "Comments and Activity" section, click the image icon. A modal window will appear.
2. **Add your image**: You have two options for adding your image:
    *   **Drag and drop**: Drag an image file from your computer and drop it into the modal window.
    *   **Choose a file**: Click the "Choose a file" button (or similar text) within the modal to open your device's file browser. Navigate to and select the image file you wish to upload.
3. **Upload the image**: The upload will begin automatically after you've dropped the file or selected it from the browser.

The picture will appear in the activity feed once the upload is complete.
