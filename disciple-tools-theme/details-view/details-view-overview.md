# Disciple.Tools | Record Details View Overview

The Record Details page is the heart of Disciple.Tools, providing a complete, single-page view of all information related to a specific record, such as a contact or a group. From this page, you can view and edit information, see a complete history of activity, and perform various actions.

## Accessing the Details View
You can access the Details View for any record by clicking on its name from a List View (e.g., the Contacts List or Groups List).

## Layout of the Page
The Record Details page is organized into three main sections:

1.  **Details Bar**: A header bar at the top of the page containing the record's name, key action buttons, and navigation to move between records.
2.  **Details Tiles**: The main content area on the left, which is a collection of "tiles." Each tile is a box that groups related information together, such as the "Status" tile or the "Details" tile.
3.  **Activity & Comments**: A sidebar on the right that displays a chronological timeline of all activity and comments related to the record. This is where you can log updates, ask questions, and collaborate with your team. 

## Getting the Record ID
The record ID for a contact or group is the number at the end of the URL. 
For example, for the URL `https://example.com/contacts/1284/`, the ID is `1284`.
