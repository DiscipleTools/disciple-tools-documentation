Comments are available on all record detail pages in Disciple.Tools:

### Mentioning Users in Comments

You can notify specific team members by mentioning them in comments:

1. **Type the @ symbol** followed by the user's name (e.g., `@John Doe`)
2. **Select the correct user** from the dropdown list that appears
3. **Complete your comment** and submit it normally

**What happens when you mention someone:**

- Their name appears as a clickable link in the comment
- They can quickly navigate to the record to see the full context

### Formatting Comments with Markdown

You can use Markdown to format your comments. This allows for bolding, italics, lists, links, and images.

**Text Formatting**

- **Bold:** Wrap your text in two asterisks. Example: `**This is bold text**` will appear as **This is bold text**. You can also use two underscores: `__This is bold text__`.
- *Italics:* Wrap your text in one asterisk. Example: `*This is italicized text*` will appear as *This is italicized text*.

**Lists**

- **Unordered Lists:** Start each line with a hyphen `-`, an asterisk `*`, or a plus `+`.
  Example:
  ```
  - First item
  - Second item
  ```
- **Ordered Lists:** Start each line with a number followed by a period.
  Example:
  ```
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  ```

**Links**

You can create a link by wrapping the link text in brackets `[ ]` and the URL in parentheses `( )`.
Example: `[Disciple.Tools](https://disciple.tools)` will appear as [Disciple.Tools](https://disciple.tools). URLs are also automatically converted to clickable links.

**Images**

You can embed an image by using an exclamation mark `!`, followed by alt text in brackets `[ ]`, and the image URL in parentheses `( )`.
Example: `![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)`
