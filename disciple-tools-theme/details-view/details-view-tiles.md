# Disciple.Tools | Record Details Tiles

The main body of the Record Details page is composed of "tiles." Each tile is a container that groups and displays related fields and information about the record. The system is designed to be modular, showing only the tiles and fields that are relevant to the specific record type.

## Tile Structure and Behavior

-   **Collapsible Sections**: Each tile has a header. You can click on the header to collapse or expand the tile, allowing you to hide information you don't currently need.
-   **Conditional Display**: Some tiles may only appear if certain conditions are met. For example, a "Coaching" tile might only be displayed for contacts who are actively being coached.
-   **Hidden Tiles**: Your system administrator can hide certain tiles. A "Show Hidden Tiles" button will appear at the bottom of the page if there are any hidden tiles that you can view.

## Core Tiles

While many tiles can exist, two of the most important are the **Status Tile** and the **Details Tile**.

### Status Tile
This tile is located at the top of the details section and displays critical, high-level status information about the record. This can include fields like:
-   **Contact Status**: (e.g., Active, Paused, Closed).
-   **Seeker Path**: (e.g., Seeker, Disciple, Church Leader).
-   **Faith Milestones**: Key dates in the contact's spiritual journey.

### Details Tile
This tile contains the core contact and custom information for the record. Initially, it shows a collapsed, summary view of key information with icons.

-   **Collapsed View**: Provides a quick, at-a-glance summary of important details like name, phone numbers, and email addresses.
-   **Expanded View**: To see all the details, click the "Edit all details fields" button or the chevron in the tile header. This will expand the tile to show all fields and allow for editing.

The fields inside the Details Tile (and other tiles) are where the specific data for the record is stored and managed. Their appearance and behavior depend on the type of data they hold (e.g., text, dates, locations, dropdown lists).
