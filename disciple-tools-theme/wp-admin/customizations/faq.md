# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Who can access the Customizations (D.T) Section?

Only users with administrator privileges or those assigned the appropriate permissions can access the Customizations (D.T) menu.

---

## Can I undo changes made in the Customizations section?

There is no built-in undo feature. It is recommended to download a backup of your settings before making significant changes. If you make a mistake, you may need to manually revert your changes or restore from a backup.

---

## Is there a limit to the number of record types, tiles, or fields I can create?

There is no hard-coded limit, but creating a very large number of custom items may impact performance or usability. Organize your data thoughtfully for the best experience.

## What happens if I delete a record type?

Deleting a record type will permanently delete all records of that type. This action cannot be undone. Always double-check before deleting.

---

## Can I hide fields or tiles without deleting them?

Yes. You can hide fields or tiles using the "Hide" option in their settings. Hidden items are not visible to users but can be restored later if needed.

---

## Why can’t I see the Customizations (D.T) menu?

You may not have the required permissions. Contact your site administrator to request access.

## How do I control which users can see or edit certain record types?

Use the Role Permissions tab to grant or restrict access for each user role on a per-record-type basis.

---

## What should I do if my changes don’t appear immediately?

Try refreshing your browser or clearing your cache. Some changes may require a page reload to take effect.

---

## Can I export or import my customization settings?

Yes. Use the settings export/import tools (usually found in the Utilities section) to back up or transfer your configuration.
