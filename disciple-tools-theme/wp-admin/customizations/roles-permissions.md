# Role Permissions

Role permissions allow you to control which user roles can view, create, edit, or delete each record type in Disciple.Tools. This helps you tailor access to sensitive information and ensure users only see whatâ€™s relevant to their role.

5. Click update button to save changes.

## What Are Role Permissions?

Each user in Disciple.Tools is assigned a role (such as Administrator, DT Admin, or custom roles). For each record type, you can specify what actions each role is allowed to perform:

- **View**: See records of this type
- **Create**: Add new records
- **Update**: Edit existing records
- **Delete**: Remove records
- Other specific permissions as available

## Why Manage Role Permissions?

- Protect sensitive information
- Simplify the user experience by hiding irrelevant features
- Ensure only authorized users can make changes
