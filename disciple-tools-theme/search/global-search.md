### Filtering by Record Type

You can narrow your search to specific types of records, such as Contacts, Groups, or other record types enabled on your system.

**On Desktop:**

*   To the left of the search results, you will see a list of available record types.
*   By default, the search will look across **All** record types.
*   To filter your search, click on the name of the record type you want to search within (e.g., "Contacts"). The search results will update automatically.

**On Mobile:**

*   A dropdown menu will appear above the search results.
*   Tap the dropdown and select the desired record type to filter your search.

### Advanced Search Filters

For more specific searches, you can use the advanced search filters. These allow you to control what parts of a record are searched.

*   The filter options are located next to the record type list (on desktop) or within the filter dropdown (on mobile).
*   You can choose to include or exclude the following from your search:
    *   **Posts**: Searches the main content of the records.
    *   **Comments**: Searches all comments and activity on the records.
    *   **Meta**: Searches additional fields and data associated with the records.

### Understanding the Search Results

The search results are grouped by record type.

*   Each record type that has matching results will have its own section.
*   At the top of the results, you will see a total count of all records found.
*   If there are many results for a particular record type, a **Load More** button will appear at the bottom of that section. Click this to see more results for that record type.
