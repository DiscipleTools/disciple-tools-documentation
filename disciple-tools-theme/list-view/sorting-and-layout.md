# Sorting and Layout in Disciple.Tools List View

The Disciple.Tools List View provides several options to control the sorting and layout of your records, allowing you to organize the information in a way that best suits your needs.

## Sorting the List

You can sort the records in the list based on different criteria, such as creation date or modification date.

**How to sort the list:**

1.  Locate the "Sort" dropdown menu in the header section of the main list area.
2.  Click on the "Sort" menu to reveal the available sorting options.
3.  The typical sorting options include:
    *   **Newest**: Sorts the records by their creation date, with the most recently created records at the top.
    *   **Oldest**: Sorts by creation date, with the oldest records at the top.
    *   **Most recently modified**: Sorts by the date of the last update, with the most recently updated records at the top.
    *   **Least recently modified**: Sorts by the date of the last update, with the least recently updated records at the top.
4.  Select your desired sorting option. The list will automatically reorder based on your selection.

## Show Archived Records

Disciple.Tools allows you to archive records that are no longer active but that you want to keep for historical purposes. By default, these archived records are hidden from the List View.

**How to show archived records:**

1.  In the header of the main list area, you will find a toggle switch labeled "Show Archived" (the exact label may vary, e.g., "Show Inactive").
2.  Click this toggle switch to the "on" position.
3.  The list will refresh to include all archived records that match the current filter.
4.  When archived records are shown, the toggle switch will be highlighted. To hide them again, simply click the toggle switch back to the "off" position.

This feature is useful for reviewing past work or reactivating records that have been archived.

## List Table Layout

The main list area is a table where each row represents a record and each column represents a field.

-   **Record Link**: The name of the record (e.g., the contact's name) is usually a link that will take you to the detailed record page.
-   **Customizable Columns**: You can customize which columns are visible and in what order they appear.
-   **Checkboxes**: When a bulk action is initiated (like Bulk Edit), a checkbox will appear at the beginning of each row for selecting records.
-   **Load More**: If there are more records than can be displayed on one page, a "Load More" button will appear at the bottom of the list. Click this button to load the next set of records. This is known as infinite scrolling.

The layout is designed to be clean and readable, providing a clear overview of your records while giving you the tools to dive deeper when needed.
