# Bulk Editing Records in Disciple.Tools

The Bulk Edit feature in Disciple.Tools allows you to update multiple records simultaneously from any list page. This is a powerful tool for making mass changes, such as assigning a list of contacts to a different user or updating the status for multiple records at once.

## How to Bulk Edit Records

It is often helpful to filter your list before using the bulk edit feature. This allows you to narrow down the records and ensure you are only modifying the ones you intend to change.

1.  From a list page (e.g., Contacts, Groups), click the **More** button and select **Bulk Edit**. This will activate selection checkboxes for each record in the list.
2.  Select the records you want to edit by checking the box next to each one. You can also use the checkbox in the table header to select all currently visible records.
3.  As you select records, a bulk edit panel will appear on the right side of the screen with fields you can modify.
4.  Update the fields as needed. For example, you can select a new user from the **Assigned To** dropdown or change the **Status**.
5.  Once you have made your changes, click the **Update** button. The changes will be applied to all the records you selected.
6.  You can also add a comment to all selected records at once using the comment box provided in the bulk edit panel.

## How to Bulk Delete Records

You can also delete multiple records at once using the bulk edit feature. It is highly recommended to filter your list first to prevent accidental deletion of records.

1.  From a list page, click the **More** button and select **Bulk Edit**.
2.  Select the records you want to delete.
3.  In the bulk edit panel, click the **Delete** button.
4.  A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **OK** to confirm that you want to delete the selected records. The records will be moved to the trash.

## Who Can Bulk Delete?

The ability to bulk delete records is restricted to specific user roles for security. Only users with the **Administrator** or **D.T. Admin** roles have the necessary permissions to delete records in bulk. If you do not see the delete option in the bulk edit panel, it is because you do not have the required role.
