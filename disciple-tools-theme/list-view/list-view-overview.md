# Disciple.Tools List View Overview

## What is the List View?

The List View is the main screen in Disciple.Tools for managing records like Contacts, Groups, and Trainings. It's where you can find, sort, filter, and update your data. This page acts as a central hub for all your records, providing tools to organize and interact with them efficiently.

## Key Features of the List View Page

The List View page is organized into three main sections to help you access and manage your records.

### 1. Action Bar

The Action Bar is located at the top of the List View page. It contains the primary controls for working with your records.

- **Create New Record**: On the left side of the action bar, you will find a "New" button to add a new record (e.g., "New Contact").
- **Search**: A search bar is available to quickly find records by name or other identifiers.
- **Filter and Sort Options**: Buttons to access advanced filtering and sorting options are located here.
- **Bulk Actions**: When you select one or more records, options for bulk actions like updating status or assigning records will appear.

### 2. Filters Sidebar

The Filters Sidebar is on the left side of the page. It provides powerful tools to narrow down your list of records.

- **Default Filters**: Use pre-defined filters like "Active Contacts" or "My Contacts" to quickly view common record sets.
- **Custom Filters**: Create your own filters based on any field to segment your data precisely.
- **Split By**: This tool allows you to segment your list into groups based on criteria like location or status, showing counts for each segment.
- **Export**: You can export your filtered list to a CSV file for reporting or analysis.

### 3. Main List Area

This is the central part of the page where the list of records is displayed in a table format.

- **Customizable Columns**: You can choose which columns to display to see the most relevant information for your needs. Click the column icon to add or remove columns.
- **Sorting**: Click on any column header to sort the list by that field in ascending or descending order.
- **Record Checkboxes**: Each row has a checkbox. Selecting one or more checkboxes enables bulk actions in the Action Bar.
- **Individual Records**: Clicking on a record's name will take you to its details page.

## Mobile vs. Desktop Interface

The List View is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices. The functionality is the same, but the layout adapts to the screen size.

-   **Desktop View**: On a larger screen, the layout is wider. The Filters Sidebar is always visible on the left, and the Action Bar displays both text and icons for its options.
-   **Mobile View**: On a mobile device, to save space, the Action Bar is condensed to show only icons. The search and filter options are accessed by tapping dedicated buttons, which then reveal the filtering sidebar.

This documentation will specify any differences in functionality between the desktop and mobile interfaces.
