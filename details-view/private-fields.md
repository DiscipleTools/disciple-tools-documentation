# Disciple.Tools | Private Record Fields

This guide explains what Private Fields are and how they work on a record's Details Page in Disciple.Tools.

## What are Private Fields?

Private Fields are special fields on a contact or group record that are visible only to the user who entered the data. They provide a secure way to store sensitive or personal notes that should not be shared with other team members.

## How to Identify a Private Field

You can easily identify a private field by the **lock icon** (ðŸ”’) displayed next to the field's label. When you hover your mouse over the lock icon, a tooltip will appear with the text: "Private Field: Only I can see its content."

## Who Can See the Content?

The information entered into a private field is confidential and tied to your user account. 

- **Only you** can see and edit the content you enter into a private field.
- Other users, including administrators, **cannot see** the information in your private fields.
- The data in these fields is **not included in exports** and is kept separate during record merges.

This ensures that your personal notes on a record remain completely private. Any information that needs to be collaborated on with your team should be entered into standard, non-private fields.
