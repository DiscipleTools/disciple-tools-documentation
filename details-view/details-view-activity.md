# Disciple.Tools | Record Activity & Comments

The Activity & Comments section is a sidebar on the right side of the record details page. It provides a complete, chronological timeline of every update and communication related to the record, serving as its official history.

## Adding Comments

At the top of the section is a comment box where you can log updates, add notes, or communicate with your team. 
- **Type your message** in the text area.
- **Mention users** with `@` to send them a notification.
- **Choose a comment type** to categorize your note.
- Click **"Add Comment"** to save it to the timeline.

For a complete guide on comment features, see the [Comments documentation](comments.md).

## Activity Timeline

Below the comment box is the activity timeline. It shows a history of everything that has happened to the record, in reverse chronological order (newest first).

The timeline is not just a list of comments; it is a comprehensive log that includes:
-   **User-submitted comments**, notes, and updates.
-   **System-generated entries** for every field change (e.g., "Contact Status changed from Active to Paused by Jane Doe").
-   **Records of actions** like sharing, assignments, and other significant events in the record's lifecycle.
