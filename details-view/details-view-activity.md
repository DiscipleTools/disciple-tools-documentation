# Disciple.Tools | Record Activity & Comments

The Activity & Comments section is a sidebar on the right side of the record details page. It provides a complete, chronological timeline of every update and communication related to the record, serving as its official history.

## Adding Comments and Updates

At the top of the section is a comment box where you can log updates, add notes, or ask questions.

-   **Log an Activity**: Type your note into the text area.
-   **Mention Users**: You can mention another user by typing `@` followed by their name (e.g., `@John Doe`). The mentioned user will receive a notification.
-   **Set Comment Type**: You can categorize your comment using the dropdown menu below the text box. Comment types can include "Comment," "Update," "Coaching," etc.
-   **Submit**: Click the "Add Comment" button to save your note to the timeline.

## Activity Timeline

Below the comment box is the activity timeline, which shows all history for the record in reverse chronological order (newest first). This is not just a list of comments; it is a comprehensive log of everything that happens to the record.

The timeline includes:
-   User-submitted comments, notes, and updates.
-   System-generated entries for every field change (e.g., "Contact Status changed from Active to Paused by Jane Doe").
-   Records of sharing actions, assignments, and any other significant event in the record's lifecycle.

## Filtering Activity

You can filter the timeline to see only the types of activity you are interested in. Use the filter icon at the top of the timeline to show or hide different categories of activity, such as comments, field changes, or coaching updates.
