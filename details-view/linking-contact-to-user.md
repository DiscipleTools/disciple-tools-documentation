# Link a Contact to an Existing User

If you have a contact record that should be linked to a person who is already a user in Disciple.Tools, you can link them together. This is useful to avoid duplicate information and to show that a contact record and a user account belong to the same person.

For example, a new contact is created by a webform, but you know that person is already a user on your Disciple.Tools site. You can link the new contact record with their existing user account.

This option is available for users with Admin and User Management roles.

## How to Link a Contact to a User

1.  Go to the contact record you want to link.
2.  In the **Admin Actions** dropdown at the top of the page, click on **Link to an existing user**.
3.  A new window will appear. If the contact is already linked to a user, you will see the message: "This contact already represents a user." and you will not be able to proceed.
4.  If the contact is not linked, you will see "To link to an existing user, first, find the user using the field below.". Start typing the name of the user you want to link to in the search box.
5.  A list of users will appear. Click on the name of the user you want to link the contact to.
6.  A new section will appear with the text "To finish the linking, merge this contact with the existing user details." along with a **Merge** button.
7.  Click the **Merge** button to link the contact record to the selected user account.
8.  The system will then merge the details. Now, the contact record is linked to the user account. Any updates made to the contact record might affect the user's details, and vice versa, depending on your system's configuration.

When a contact is linked to a user, a notification "This contact represents a user." will be displayed at the top of the contact record.
