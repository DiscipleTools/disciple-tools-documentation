# Disciple.Tools | Record Details Bar

The Details Bar is located at the top of every record page. It displays the record's name and provides a set of tools for navigation and common actions.

## Record Title and Navigation

The center of the bar shows the record's profile picture (if available) and its name. To the left and right of the title, you will find navigation arrows.

-   **Previous Record** (left arrow): Navigates to the previous record in the list you came from.
-   **Next Record** (right arrow): Navigates to the next record in the list you came from.

These navigation arrows only appear when you have accessed the record from a list view.

## Action Buttons

A series of buttons on the right side of the bar allow for quick actions:

-   **Favorite** (Star Icon): Mark the record as a favorite for easy access later.
-   **Tasks**: Manage or create tasks related to the record.
-   **Follow/Following**: Subscribe to notifications for any updates made to this record. If you are assigned to the record, you will follow it automatically.
-   **Share**: Share the record with another user, giving them access to view and collaborate.

## Record Management Tools

On the left side of the details bar are additional tools for managing the record.
