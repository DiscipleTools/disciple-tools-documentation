# Project Metrics: Critical Path

The Critical Path report is the most comprehensive view of your ministry's overall health and progress. It provides a top-level summary of all key activities across the entire project, from initial outreach to the multiplication of disciples and churches. It is an essential tool for leaders to track movement-wide trends.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Access** > **Critical Path**.

## Understanding the Critical Path Report

The Critical Path report is presented as a table that summarizes activity over a specific time period. You can use the date filter at the top of the page to view data for a custom range, such as the last month, the last year, or the entire history of the project.

The report is divided into sections that follow the typical journey of a disciple.

### Outreach
This section tracks the earliest activities designed to make new connections. It often includes metrics from integrated services like social media or websites.
- **Metrics**: The specific metrics shown here depend on what is being tracked by your system, but can include items like `Website Visitors` or `Social Media Interactions`.
- **Value**: The number of interactions recorded during the selected time period.
- **Total**: The cumulative total of these interactions since the beginning of tracking.

### Follow Up
This section tracks the progress of new contacts as they move through the discipleship pipeline.
- **New Contacts**: The number of new contacts created in the selected time period.
- **Assigned Contacts**: Contacts that were assigned to a user for follow-up.
- **Active Contacts**: Contacts with an "Active" status.
- **Seeker Path Milestones**: The report shows counts for each step in your site's configured Seeker Path (e.g., `First Meeting`, `Ongoing Meetings`, `Being Coached`).

### Movement Training
This final section tracks the multiplication of disciples and churches, which is the ultimate goal of a Disciple Making Movement.
- **Baptisms**: Total baptisms recorded.
- **Baptism Generations**: A breakdown of baptisms by generation (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) to show spiritual multiplication.
- **Groups**: The number of active groups.
- **Churches**: The number of active groups designated as churches.
- **Church Generations**: A breakdown of churches by generation to show church-planting multiplication.

By analyzing the numbers from each section, leaders can identify bottlenecks in their discipleship process and celebrate areas of strong growth.
