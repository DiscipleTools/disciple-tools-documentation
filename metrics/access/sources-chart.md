# Project Metrics: Sources Chart

The Sources Chart report helps you understand which of your outreach channels are most effective at generating new contacts. It provides a detailed breakdown of your contacts by their "Source" and visualizes how those sources perform against other key metrics like contact status and seeker path progression.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Access** > **Sources Chart**.

## Understanding the Report

This report is composed of several charts, each providing a different perspective on your contact sources. You can use the date filter at the top of the page to focus on contacts created within a specific time period.

### All Contacts by Source and Status

This is the main chart in the report. It displays a stacked bar for each contact source.
*   **Each bar** represents a single source (e.g., `Web`, `Social Media`, `Referral`).
*   **The segments** within each bar show the current status of all contacts from that source (e.g., `New`, `Active`, `Paused`, `Closed`).
*   **The total length** of the bar represents the total number of contacts that have come from that source.

This chart is excellent for quickly seeing not only which sources produce the most contacts, but also the quality of those contacts based on their current status.

### Active Contacts by Source and Seeker Path

This chart focuses only on your "Active" contacts and breaks them down by their position in the Seeker Path.
*   **Each bar** represents a single source.
*   **The segments** within each bar show how many active contacts from that source are at each stage of the Seeker Path (e.g., `First Meeting`, `Ongoing Meetings`).

This helps you understand which sources are producing contacts that are progressing in their discipleship journey.

### Active Contacts by Source and Faith Milestones

Similar to the previous chart, this report focuses only on "Active" contacts but visualizes them against their recorded faith milestones (e.g., `Has a Bible`, `Baptized`).
*   **Each bar** represents a single source.
*   **The segments** represent the different faith milestones that have been recorded for contacts from that source.

This chart provides insight into which outreach channels are leading to significant spiritual outcomes.
