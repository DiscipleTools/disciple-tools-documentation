# Project Metrics: Transferred Contacts

The Transferred Contacts report provides insights into the contacts that have been **sent to** other Disciple.Tools sites through the Site Linking system. This is a powerful feature for collaborative ministry efforts, allowing you to see not just the number of contacts being transferred, but also what happened to them after the transfer.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Access** > **Transferred Contacts**.

## Understanding the Report

This report is interactive, allowing you to pull data from any site that is configured to receive contacts from your instance. It shows the status of the contacts on the *receiving site*.

### Using the Filters

At the top of the page, you will find two filters:
*   **Date Range:** Select the time period you want to analyze. The report will show metrics for contacts transferred within this range.
*   **Site Links:** Choose one of the available linked sites from the dropdown menu. The data displayed will be for contacts **sent to** that specific site.

### Key Metrics Displayed

After selecting a site and date range, the report will display several charts and a total count based on data from the receiving site:

*   **Contacts Transferred:** A total count of all contacts **sent to** the selected site within the chosen date range.
*   **Contact Status:** A chart showing the current status (`Active`, `Paused`, `Closed`) of the transferred contacts **on the receiving site**.
*   **Seeker Path:** A breakdown of the transferred contacts by their current stage in the Seeker Path **on the receiving site**.
*   **Faith Milestones:** A chart visualizing the faith milestones that have been recorded for the transferred contacts **on the receiving site**.

These charts help you understand the journey and spiritual development of the contacts after they have been transferred, providing valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your ministry partnerships.
