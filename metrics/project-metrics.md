# Project Metrics

Project Metrics provide a high-level overview of all activity across your Disciple.Tools instance. These reports are designed to help leaders and administrators understand broad trends, track overall progress, and see the collective impact of the team.

**Note**: Access to Project Metrics is controlled by permissions. You must have the `view_project_metrics` capability to see this section. If you do not see the **Project** menu under Metrics, you do not have the necessary permissions.

To view Project Metrics, navigate to the **Metrics** section and select an option from the **Project** submenu.
