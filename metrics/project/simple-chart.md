# Project Metrics: Simple Chart

The Simple Chart report provides a way to visualize the distribution of your records based on dropdowns, multi-selects and tags fields. It generates a bar chart showing the total count for each available option within a field, giving you a snapshot of your data at a specific point in time.

This report is particularly useful for understanding the composition of your contacts and groups. For example, you can use it to see how many contacts have a specific tag, come from a particular source, or are at a certain stage in the Seeker Path.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Project** > **Simple Chart**.

## Building a Chart

This report is interactive. You build the chart you want to see using the filters at the top of the page.

1.  **Select a Record Type**: Use the first dropdown menu to choose the type of record you want to analyze (e.g., `Contacts`, `Groups`).

2.  **Select a Field**: The second dropdown will show all the fields for the chosen record type that can be visualized with this chart (specifically, fields like tags, dropdowns, and multi-selects). Choose the field you want to analyze.

3.  **Select a Date**: Use the date picker to choose the specific date for your snapshot. The chart will show the total counts for each tag or option as they were on that day.

## Reading the Chart

Once you make your selections, a bar chart will be generated.

*   **Each bar** on the chart represents one of the available options for the field you selected (e.g., a specific tag or a dropdown value).
*   **The length of the bar** corresponds to the total number of records that had that tag or option on the selected date.

This provides a clear and immediate visual breakdown of your data, helping you quickly identify the largest and smallest segments within any category.
