# Project Metrics: Locations List

The Locations List report displays your project's geographic data in a detailed, sortable table. Each row represents a specific geographic area (country, state, county, etc.), and the columns show the number of records in that area.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Project** > **Locations List**.

## Understanding the List

*   **Data Columns**: The table includes columns for `Contacts`, `Groups`, `Churches`, and `Users`, showing the count of each within a geographic boundary.
*   **Drill Down**: You can click on any location name to "drill down" and see a more detailed breakdown of the sub-locations within it. For example, clicking on a country will show you a list of all the states or provinces within that country that have recorded activity.
*   **Sorting**: You can sort the entire table by any column by clicking on the column header. This allows you to quickly find the areas with the most contacts, the highest number of users, or the most churches.
