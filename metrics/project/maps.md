# Project Metrics: Maps

The Project Maps report provides an interactive map to visualize the geographic location of all contacts, groups, and users across the entire project. This tool helps leaders understand the overall geographic spread of the ministry, identify areas of concentration, and spot regions with potential for growth.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Project** > **Maps**.

## Understanding the Map Interface

When you first load the report, you will see a world map. You can add different "layers" of data to this map to plot your records.

*   **Clustering**: When you are zoomed out, individual records are grouped into "clusters," which appear as circles with a number inside. The number represents the count of records in that geographic area.
*   **Drill Down**: Clicking on a cluster will zoom you in to that area, revealing smaller clusters or individual record points.
*   **Point Information**: Clicking on an individual point on the map will show you the name of the record at that location and provide a link to view the full record page.

## Adding and Filtering Layers

The power of this report lies in its use of layers. You can add multiple layers to the map and customize each one with filters to visualize exactly the data you need.

1.  **Add a Layer**:
    *   Click the **Add Records** button in the map's action bar.
    *   Select the type of record you want to display (e.g., `Contacts`, `Groups`, `Users`).
    *   A new layer will be added to the control panel on the left.

2.  **Filter a Layer**:
    *   Once a layer is added, you can apply filters to it. Click on the new layer in the control panel to open its filter options.
    *   You can filter by any selectable field on that record type. For example, for contacts, you could filter by `Status` to only show "Active" contacts, or by `Source` to only show contacts from the "Web."
    *   You can add multiple filters to a single layer to create very specific views of your data.

3.  **Manage Layers**:
    *   You can toggle the visibility of any layer by clicking the "eye" icon next to its name.
    *   You can delete a layer by clicking the trash can icon.

By adding and filtering different layers, you can create custom maps that answer specific questions about the geographic nature of your project. For example, you could create a map that shows all active groups across the project and, in a separate layer, all unassigned contacts.
