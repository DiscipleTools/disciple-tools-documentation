# Project Metrics: Simple Map

The Simple Map provides a high-level, at-a-glance overview of your project's geographic footprint. It displays the locations of all contacts, groups, churches, and users on a single world map, showing the density of activity in different regions.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Project** > **Simple Map**.

## Understanding the Map

This report is designed for simplicity and quick analysis.

*   **Colored Regions**: The map is divided into geographic regions (countries, states, etc.). Regions are color-coded based on the density of records they contain. The darker the color, the more records (contacts, groups, etc.) are located in that area.
*   **Hover for Details**: Hovering your mouse over any colored region will display a pop-up with a breakdown of the exact number of `Contacts`, `Groups`, `Churches`, and `Users` in that area.
*   **Drill Down**: Clicking on a colored region will zoom the map in to show the next level of detail. For example, clicking on a country will zoom in to show the breakdown by its states or provinces.

The Simple Map is an excellent tool for quickly identifying where your ministry is concentrated and for getting a broad overview of your global or national impact without the complexity of filters and layers.
