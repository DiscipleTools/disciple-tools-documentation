# Project Metrics: Activity Logs

The Activity Logs report is a powerful search tool that lets you find all record updates that occurred within a specific period. You can use it to generate a detailed list of activities, such as all contacts created last month, all groups that had their status changed in the last week, or all assignments made yesterday.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Project** > **Activity Logs**.

## How to Use the Report

This report is a search tool. You use the filters at the top to define what you are looking for, and it will generate a table of results.

1.  **Select a Date Range**: Use the date picker to define the start and end dates for your search.

2.  **Select a Record Type**: Choose the type of record you want to investigate (e.g., `Contacts`, `Groups`).

3.  **Select a Field**: Choose the specific field you are interested in. You can select "Any Activity" to see all updates for the chosen record type, or you can narrow your search to a single field, like `Status`, `Assigned To`, or `Location`.

4.  **(Optional) Filter by Field Value**: If you select a specific field, a new filter may appear allowing you to narrow your search even further. For example, if you choose the `Status` field, you can then choose to only see records that were changed *to* "Active".

5.  **Click Reload**: After setting your filters, click the "Reload" button to generate the report.

## Reading the Results

The report will generate a table with a list of all activity log entries that match your search criteria. Each row in the table represents a single action and includes the following information:

*   **Title**: The name of the record that was updated. This is a clickable link that will take you directly to that record.
*   **Time Activity Recorded**: The exact date and time the update occurred.
*   **New Value**: The value that the selected field was changed to. For example, if you are searching for `Status` changes, this column will show the new status that was set.

This report is an excellent tool for auditing changes, generating activity reports for a specific period, or investigating when a particular update was made.
