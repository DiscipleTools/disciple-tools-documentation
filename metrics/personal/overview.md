# Personal Metrics: Overview

The Personal Overview report is your main dashboard for tracking the health and progress of your ministry. It combines several key charts and stats into a single view, giving you a comprehensive snapshot of the contacts and groups you are responsible for.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Personal** > **Overview**.

## What This Report Shows

The Overview is composed of several data cards, each focusing on a different aspect of your ministry.

### Key Stat Cards

At the top of the page, you will find several cards displaying your most important "hero" numbers:

*   **Active Contacts**: The total number of your contacts who have an "Active" status.
*   **Total Groups**: The total number of groups you are assigned to.
*   **Needs Update**: A count of your contacts who have not been updated recently and may need follow-up.
*   **Needs Accept**: A count of new contacts that have been assigned to you and are waiting for you to accept them.

### Follow-up of my active contacts

This chart provides a visual breakdown of your active contacts by their current status (e.g., "New," "Contact Attempted," "Meeting Scheduled"). It helps you see where your contacts are in the discipleship pipeline and who might need attention.

### Active Group Health Metrics

This report visualizes the health of your active groups based on the "Health Metrics" you track (e.g., "Leader," "Tithing," "Word"). For each metric, it shows how many of your groups are actively practicing it versus how many are not. This is crucial for identifying areas where your groups may need training or support.

### Group and Church Generations

This chart displays the multiplication of your groups and churches over time. It shows the number of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation groups, helping you visualize the impact of your church-planting efforts.

### Group Types

This is a simple pie chart that shows the distribution of your groups by their designated type (e.g., "Group," "Church," "Legacy"). It helps you understand the composition of the groups you lead.
