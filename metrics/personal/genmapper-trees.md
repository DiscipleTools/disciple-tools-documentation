# Personal Metrics: GenMapper Trees

The GenMapper Trees report provides a powerful visualization of your ministry network as a tree or organization chart. It helps you see the connections and generational growth of disciples, groups, and churches that you are a part of. This is a key tool for tracking multiplication and understanding the structure of your movement.

To access this report, navigate to **Metrics** > **Personal** > **GenMapper Trees**.

## Understanding the Tree

The GenMapper Trees report displays records as "nodes" in a tree, with lines connecting them to show their relationships.

*   **Parent/Child Nodes**: The tree shows parent/child relationships. For example, a "parent" group might have several "child" groups that it planted.
*   **Your Position**: When you first load the report, your contact record will be at the top of the tree, showing the network that flows from you.
*   **Node Details**: Clicking on any node will show more details in the side panel.

## Interacting with the Tree

The GenMapper Trees report is fully interactive.

*   **Building a Tree**: Use the dropdown menus at the top of the page to build different trees. You can visualize different types of relationships, such as `Coached By`, `Parent Group`, or `Baptized By`.
*   **Focusing on a Node**: Click on any node in the tree and select "Focus" to rebuild the entire tree with that node as the new top of the tree. This allows you to explore any branch of the network in more detail.
*   **Data Layers**: You can add "Data Layers" to color-code the nodes based on a specific field, such as `Status` or `Health Metrics`. This adds another level of visual analysis to the tree, allowing you to spot trends or areas of concern quickly.
*   **Showing Archived Records**: By default, archived or inactive records are hidden. You can check the "Show Archived" box to include them in the tree, which can be useful for historical analysis.

By building different trees and applying data layers, you can gain deep insights into the structure, health, and growth of your personal ministry network.
