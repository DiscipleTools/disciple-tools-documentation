## Understanding the Activity Log

The Activity Log displays a continuous stream of your activities, with the most recent actions appearing at the top. Each entry in the log provides key details about an action that was performed.

### What is Recorded?

The log captures a wide range of activities, including but not limited to:

*   **Creating Records**: When you create a new contact, group, or other type of post.
*   **Updating Records**: Any changes made to a record's fields, such as updating a contact's status, changing a group's name, or adding a location.
*   **Posting Comments**: Every comment you write on a contact or group record.
*   **Assigning Records**: When you assign a contact or group to another user.
*   **Milestone Updates**: When you log a milestone, like a baptism or a first meeting.

Each entry includes:
- A description of the action taken.
- The name of the record that was affected.
- The time the action occurred.

This report is especially useful for reviewing your work history or finding the specific time you made a particular update.
