# Disciple.Tools User Documentation

This repository contains the user-facing documentation for the Disciple.Tools platform. The goal is to create clear, practical, and non-technical guidance for users to effectively utilize the system's features.

## Getting Started

All documentation contributions should adhere to the standards and guidelines outlined in this repository. Before you begin writing, please familiarize yourself with the following key documents:

- **[Documentation Rules & Guidelines](./documentation-rules.md)**: This is a critical resource that defines the core principles, content structure, and formatting requirements for all documentation. It includes standards for writing for non-technical audiences and optimizing content for AI. **Include these rules when having AI generate documentation.**

- **[Documentation To-Do List](./todo.md)**: This file lists all the pending documentation tasks. Please refer to this list to see what needs to be written and to avoid duplicating efforts.

## Creating New Documentation

When creating a new documentation file, you can use the following prompt as a starting point. We have found that AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro are effective at generating the kind of documentation we need.

**Starting Prompt:**
```
Follow @documentation-rules.md and analyse the disciple-tools-theme code and create user documentation for ...
``` 

## Contribution Workflow

1.  Review the **[Documentation Rules & Guidelines](./documentation-rules.md)**.
2.  Choose a task from the **[Documentation To-Do List](./todo.md)**.
3.  Create or edit the relevant markdown file within the directory structure.
4.  Ensure your content is code-first, verifying all instructions against the actual Disciple.Tools implementation.
5.  Follow the prescribed hierarchical structure and formatting rules.
