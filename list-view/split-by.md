# Split By

In Disciple.Tools, the **Split By** tool helps you organize a list of records (like Contacts or Groups) by a specific field. This feature provides a quick overview of your data's distribution. For example, you can split your contacts list by **Status** to see how many contacts are `new`, `active`, or `closed`.

## How to Use the Split By Tool

1.  Navigate to a list page, such as **Contacts** or **Groups**.
2.  In the sidebar filters, find the **Split By** section.
3.  Select a field from the dropdown menu. Available fields typically have a defined set of options, like **Status** or **Location**.
4.  Click the **Go** button.
5.  The results will appear below the **Go** button, showing a count of records for each option in the selected field.
6.  Clicking on a result row filters the main list. For instance, if you split by **Status**, clicking the `Active` row will show only active contacts.

## How to Remove the Split-By Filter

You can remove an active **Split By** filter in two ways:

*   Select a different field or option in the **Split By** section and click **Go** to see a new breakdown.
*   Clear the filter from the filter display area, which is located above the list table.
