# Bulk Sending Messages

This Disciple.Tools feature allows you to send a message to multiple records at once. It supports sending via email and, if configured, SMS text messages.

## How to Bulk Send a Message

1.  Navigate to a list page, such as the Contacts List page.
2.  From the action menu in the top right, click the "More" button and select "Bulk Send Message". This will activate selection checkboxes next to each record in the list.
3.  Select the records you want to message by checking the box next to their name.
4.  A message composition panel will appear.
5.  If both email and SMS are available, select the desired delivery method.
6.  Fill in the **Subject** and the **Body** of the message. You can use placeholders like `{{name}}` to personalize the message for each recipient.
7.  Review your message and the list of recipients.
8.  Click the "Send" button to send the message to all selected records.

**Note**: This feature relies on the email addresses or phone numbers associated with the contact records. Records without the required contact information (email for emails, phone number for SMS) will not receive the message.
