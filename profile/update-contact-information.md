## Important Notes

*   **Separate from Contact Records**: The contact information you enter in your profile is for your user account and is separate from any contact records in the Disciple.Tools system. Your profile information is for internal team reference.
*   **System Email**: The "Work Email" field is for general contact. To change the email address used for notifications and system communication, see the "Change System Email" option.
*   **Visibility**: This information is visible to other users in the system, helping your team members connect with you.
