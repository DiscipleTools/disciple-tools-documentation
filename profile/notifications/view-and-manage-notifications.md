## Understanding Your Notification Inbox

### Notification States

- **Read** - Notifications you've already viewed appear with lighter styling
- **All** - Shows both read and unread notifications

### Notification Information
Each notification shows:
- **Type of notification** (assignment, mention, comment, etc.)
- **Who triggered it** (which user caused the notification)
- **What record it relates to** (contact, group, or other record name)
- **When it occurred** (timestamp of the event)
- **Brief description** of what happened

## Viewing Options

### Filter Notifications
- **All Notifications** - Shows every notification you've received
- **Unread Only** - Shows only notifications you haven't read yet
- **Mentions Only** - Shows only notifications where you were @mentioned

### Navigation
- **Click any notification** to go directly to the related record
- **Use the filters** to focus on specific types of notifications
- **Scroll down** to see older notifications

## Managing Individual Notifications

### Mark as Read/Unread
- **Mark as Read**: Click the notification or use the mark as read option
- **Mark as Unread**: Use the mark as unread option to flag notifications for later attention
- **Auto-mark as Read**: Notifications are automatically marked as read when you click on them

### Taking Action
- **Click the notification** to go to the related contact, group, or record
- **View the context** of what triggered the notification
- **Respond appropriately** (add comments, update records, etc.)

## Managing All Notifications

### Mark All as Read
1. Go to your notifications page
2. Look for the **Mark All as Read** button
3. Click it to mark all current notifications as read
4. This clears your notification count and marks everything as viewed

### Load More Notifications
- Notifications are loaded in batches for better performance
- Scroll to the bottom of the notifications page
- Click **Load More** to see older notifications
- You can view your complete notification history this way

## Notification Behavior

### Real-time Updates
- Your notification count updates automatically while you're using Disciple.Tools
- New notifications appear immediately in your notification dropdown
- The page refreshes notification counts without requiring page reload

### Automatic Access
- When you receive a notification about a record, you automatically gain access to view that record
- This is especially important for @mentions - you can view records you were mentioned in even if you weren't previously assigned to them
- This access is temporary and may be removed if you're not actively involved with the record

## Notification Dropdown Features

### Quick Actions
- **View recent notifications** without leaving your current page
- **Click notifications** to jump directly to related records
- **See notification count** at a glance

### Dropdown Content
- Shows your **most recent notifications** (typically last 10-15)
- Displays **unread notifications first**
- Provides **quick access** to the full notifications page

## Best Practices

### Daily Notification Management
1. **Check your notifications** regularly using the bell icon
2. **Click on notifications** to view related records and take action
3. **Mark as read** notifications you've addressed
4. **Use filters** to focus on specific types when you have many notifications

### Staying Organized
- **Respond promptly** to assignment and mention notifications
- **Use "Mark All as Read"** periodically to keep your notification count manageable
- **Check the full notifications page** weekly to review older notifications you might have missed

### For Busy Users
- **Focus on mentions first** - these usually require your direct attention
- **Check assignments daily** - these are your primary responsibilities
- **Review other notifications** when you have time
- **Use email notifications** as a backup for important items

## Important Notes

- Notifications are personal to your account - you only see notifications relevant to you
- Clicking a notification takes you directly to the related record where you can see full context
- Your notification history is preserved so you can always go back to review past notifications
- Notifications help you stay informed about records you care about without constantly checking each one manually
