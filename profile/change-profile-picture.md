3. Your new profile picture will appear in the Profile section

## Security and Privacy Recommendations

Disciple.Tools displays the following security guidance for profile pictures:

**For Direct Upload Systems:**
> "Disciple.Tools System does not store images. All media assets will be placed within specified media connection storage service. If you have security concerns, we suggest not using a personal photo, but instead choose a cartoon, abstract, or alias photo to represent you."

**For Gravatar Systems:**
> "Disciple.Tools System does not store images. For profile images we use Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar). If you have security concerns, we suggest not using a personal photo, but instead choose a cartoon, abstract, or alias photo to represent you."

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Picture Not Updating
1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh the page
2. **Check file format** - ensure you're using GIF, JPG, JPEG, or PNG
3. **Verify file size** - very large files may fail to upload
4. **For Gravatar**: Ensure the image is associated with the correct email address

### Upload Button Not Visible
If you don't see an upload option:
- Your site uses Gravatar integration instead of direct uploads
- Contact your administrator if you need direct upload capabilities
- Use the Gravatar method described above

### Gravatar Not Appearing
1. **Email match**: Ensure your Gravatar email exactly matches your Disciple.Tools system email
2. **Gravatar approval**: New images may take time to appear
3. **Rating settings**: Check that your image meets Gravatar's rating requirements
