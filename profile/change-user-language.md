# Change User Language in Disciple.Tools

This guide explains how to change the display language for your user account in Disciple.Tools. The selected language will apply to the user interface elements like menus, buttons, and system-generated text.

## How to Access Profile Settings

You can access your profile settings to change your language using one of two methods:

**Method 1: Via Display Name**
1.  Click on your **display name** in the top right corner of the Disciple.Tools screen. This will take you directly to your **Profile Settings** page (`/settings`).

**Method 2: Via Settings Icon**
1.  Click on the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right corner of the screen.
2.  Click on **Settings** from the dropdown menu. This will also navigate you to the **Profile Settings** page (`/settings`).

## Changing Your User Language

Once you are on the **Profile Settings** page, follow these steps to change your language:

1.  In the **Profile** section, click the **Edit** button. This will open an editing modal.
2.  Find the field labeled **System Language**.
3.  Select your preferred language from the dropdown list.
4.  Click **Save** to apply the new language setting.

The Disciple.Tools interface will now refresh and be displayed in the language you selected.

## Important Notes

-   Changing the language only affects your personal view of the Disciple.Tools interface. It does not change the language for other users.
-   The list of available languages is determined by what has been installed on the Disciple.Tools instance. If your desired language is not available, contact a system administrator.
-   This setting does not translate content that has been manually entered, such as comments or details in contact records.
